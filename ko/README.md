# MAVLink Developer Guide

[![Slack](https://px4-slack.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](http://slack.px4.io)

MAVLink is a very lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones (and between onboard drone components).

MAVLink follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern: Data streams are sent / published as **topics** while configuration sub-protocols such as the [mission protocol](services/mission.md) or [parameter protocol](services/parameter.md) are point-to-point with retransmission.

Messages are [defined within XML files](messages/README.md). Each XML file defines the message set supported by a particular MAVLink system, also referred to as a "dialect". The reference message set that is implemented by *most* ground control stations and autopilots is defined in [common.xml](messages/common.md) (most dialects *build on top of* this definition).

The [MAVLink toolchain](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/) uses the XML message definitions to [generate](getting_started/generate_libraries.md) MAVLink libraries for each of the [supported programming languages](#supported_languages). Drones, ground control stations, and other MAVLink systems use the generated libraries to communicate. These are typically MIT-licensed, and can therefore be *used* without limits in any closed-source application without publishing the source code of the closed-source application.

> **Note** The C reference implementation is a header-only library that is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.

MAVLink was first released early 2009 by Lorenz Meier and has now a [significant number of contributors](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/graphs/contributors).

## Key Features

* Very efficient. MAVLink 1 has just 8 bytes overhead per packet, including start sign and packet drop detection. MAVLink 2 has just 14 bytes of overhead (but is a much more secure and extensible protocol). Because MAVLink doesn't require any additional framing it is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth.
* Very reliable. MAVLink has been used since 2009 to communicate between many different vehicles, ground stations (and other nodes) over varied and challenging communication channels (high latency/noise). It provides methods for detecting packet drops, corruption, and for packet authentication.
* Supports [many programming languages](#supported_languages), running on numerous microcontrollers/operating systems (including ARM7, ATMega, dsPic, STM32 and Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS).
* Allows up to 255 concurrent systems on the network (vehicles, ground stations, etc.)
* Enables both offboard and onboard communications (e.g. between a GCS and drone, and between drone autopilot and MAVLink enabled drone camera).

## Supported Languages {#supported_languages}

The MAVLink project includes the [mavgen](getting_started/generate_libraries.md#mavgen) and [mavgenerate](getting_started/generate_libraries.md#mavgenerate) tools that can be used to create MAVLink libraries for a number of programming languages. Additional generators have been provided by other projects.

> **Note** The MAVLink project has not validated and does not provide technical support for generators other than *mavgen* and *mavgenerate*.

The table below shows the available languages/generators, along with their support for MAVLink v1, [MAVLink 2](guide/mavlink_2.md) and [Message Signing](guide/message_signing.md).
