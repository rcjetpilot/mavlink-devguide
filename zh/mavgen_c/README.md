# Using C MAVLink Libraries (mavgen)

The MAVLink C library generated by *mavgen* is a header-only implementation that is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.

This topic explains how to get and use the library.

## Getting Libraries {#get_libraries}

If you are using a [standard dialect](../messages/README.md#dialects) then download the *MAVLink 2* library from Github: [c_library_v2](https://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v2).

> **Tip** The MAVLink 2 library supports both MAVLink 2 and MAVLink 1, and has been built with all [standard dialects](../messages/README.md#dialects) in the *mavlink/mavlink* repo. It supersedes the MAVLink 1 library ([c_library_v1](https://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v1)), and should be used by preference.

If you need libraries for a custom dialect then you will need to [install mavgen](../getting_started/installation.md) and [generate](../getting_started/generate_libraries.md) them yourself. These can then be used in the same way as the pre-generated libraries.

The libraries can be placed/generated anywhere in your project tree. The example below shows them located in: **generated/include/mavlink/v2.0/**.

## Upgrading Library from MAVLink 1

The *MAVLink 1* pre-built library [mavlink/c_library_v1](https://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v1) can be upgraded by simply dropping in the *MAVLink 2* library from Github: [mavlink/c_library_v2](https://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v2).

The MAVLink 2 C library offers the same range of APIs as was offered by MAVLink1.

> **Note** The major change from an API perspective is that you don't need to provide a message CRC table any more, or message length table. These have been folded into a single packed table, replacing the old table which was indexed by `msgId`. That was necessary to cope with the much larger 24 bit namespace of message IDs.

*MAVLink 2* usage is then covered in the following sections (this includes [Working with MAVLink 1](#mavlink_1) which explains how you can communicate with both MAVLink 2 and MAVLink 1 (only) libraries.

## Adding Libraries

To use MAVLink in your C project, include the **mavlink.h** header file in your project:

```c
#include <mavlink/mavlink.h>
```

If headers for multiple dialects and/or versions are installed, your include path might instead look similar to the following:

```c
#include <mavlink/v2.0/common/mavlink.h>
```

> **Tip** *Do not include the individual message files*. If you generate your own headers, you will have to add their output location to your C compiler's search path.

When compiling the project, we recommend that you specify the top-level output directory AND all generated dialects and versions (this will give the greatest compatibility with existing code and examples):

```sh
$ gcc ... -I generated/include -I generated/include/mavlink/v2.0/common ...
```

## Multiple Streams ("channels") {#streams}

The C MAVLink library utilizes a "channel" metaphor to allow for simultaneous processing of multiple, independent MAVLink streams in the same program. It is therefore important to use the correct channel for each operation as all receiving and transmitting functions provided by MAVLink require a channel.

If only one MAVLink stream exists, channel 0 should be used by specifying the `MAVLINK_COMM_0` constant.

## Receiving

MAVLink reception is then done using `mavlink_helpers.h:mavlink_parse_char()`.

## Transmitting

Transmitting messages can be done by using the `mavlink_msg_*_pack()` function, where one is defined for every message. The packed message can then be serialized with `mavlink_helpers.h:mavlink_msg_to_send_buffer()` and then writing the resultant byte array out over the appropriate serial interface.

It is possible to simplify the above by writing wrappers around the transmitting/receiving code. A multi-byte writing macro can be defined, `MAVLINK_SEND_UART_BYTES()`, or a single-byte function can be defined, `comm_send_ch()`, that wrap the low-level driver for transmitting the data. If this is done, `MAVLINK_USE_CONVENIENCE_FUNCTIONS` must be defined.

## Message Signing

[Message Signing (authentication)](../guide/message_signing.md) allows a *MAVLink 2* system to verify that messages originate from a trusted source.

The C libraries generated by *mavgen* provide *almost everything* needed to support message signing in your MAVLink system. The topic [C Message Signing](../mavgen_c/message_signing_c.md) explains the remaining code that a system must implement to enable signing using the C library.

## Working with MAVLink 1 {#mavlink_1}

This section explains how to use the MAVLink 2 C library to work with MAVLink 1 systems.

### Version Handshaking/Negotiation

[MAVLink Versions](../guide/mavlink_version.md) explains the [handshaking](../guide/mavlink_version.md#version_handshaking) used to determine the supported MAVLink version of either end of the channel, and how to [negotiate the version to use](#negotiating_versions).

### Sending and Receiving MAVLink 1 Packets

The *MAVLink 2* library will send packets in *MAVLink 2* framing by default. To force sending *MAVLink 1* packets on a particular channel you change the flags field of the status object.

For example, the following code causes subsequent packets on the given channel to be sent as *MAVLink 1*:

```C
mavlink_status_t* chan_state = mavlink_get_channel_status(MAVLINK_COMM_0);
chan_state->flags |= MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_OUT_MAVLINK1;
```

Incoming *MAVLink 1* packets will be automatically handled as *MAVLink 1*. If you need to determine if a particular message was received as *MAVLink 1* or *MAVLink 2* then you can use the `magic` field of the message. In c programming, this is done like this:

```c
if (msg->magic == MAVLINK_STX_MAVLINK1) {
   printf("This is a MAVLink 1 message\n");
}
```

In most cases this should not be necessary as the XML message definition files for *MAVLink 1* and *MAVLink 2* are the same, so you can treat incoming *MAVLink 1* messages the same as *MAVLink 2* messages.

> **Note** *MAVLink 1* is restricted to messageIDs less than 256, so any messages with a higher messageID won't be received as *MAVLink 1*.

It is advisable to switch to *MAVLink 2* when the communication partner sends *MAVLink 2* (see [Version Handshaking](../guide/mavlink_version.md#version_handshaking)). The minimal solution is to watch incoming packets using code similar to this:

```C
if (mavlink_parse_char(MAVLINK_COMM_0, buf[i], &msg, &status)) {

    // check if we received version 2 and request a switch.
    if (!(mavlink_get_channel_status(MAVLINK_COMM_0)->flags & MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_IN_MAVLINK1)) {
        // this will only switch to proto version 2
        chan_state->flags &= ~(MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_OUT_MAVLINK1);
    }
}
```
